# UdacityAndroidBasics-Score_Keeper_App
Project 2 of 10 in the Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree

This project was to create a Score Counter for a game (I chose baseball), an exercise in creating a working UI that responds to button presses and updates TextViews with adjusted values. While android offers a drag-n-drop feature in creating the XML file, it was always pressed to work purely with the XML code when creating the layouts for all of the projects - this yielded a far better understanding of what was going on in the code to create the visual layout.
